# github-pages-with-jekyll

A Pages demo. OK, now! After enabling it in the settings, I need to create at least one additional commit.

This triggers the page build.

Apparently, a few more lines of content are needed, because a [2nd PR didn't trigger the bot](https://github.com/katrinleinweber/github-pages-with-jekyll/pull/3) either.

I'm not sure at this point whether this [learning lab] can be recommended to novices :-/
